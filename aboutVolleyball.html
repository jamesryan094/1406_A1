                <h2>About Volleyball</h2>
                <p>
                    Volleyball is a team sport played by two teams on a playing court divided by a net.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sport originated in the United States, and is now just achieving the type of popularity in the U.S.
                    that it has received on a global basis, where it ranks behind only soccer among participation sports.
                    There are 800 million players worldwide who play Volleyball at least once a week.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The objective is to hit the ball over the net before it touches the floor.<br>
                    A point is scored when the ball touches the ground in the opponent's playing area.<br>
                    The game continues with the scoring team's back right player serving the ball.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Except while blocking, a player may not hit the ball consecutively.<br>
                    A team is allowed to hit the ball up to three times to return it to the opponent's court. (barring attempts at blocking).<br>
                    The rally continues until:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The ball touches the ground/floor</li>
                    <li>The ball goes "out"</li>
                    <li>A team fails to return the ball to the opponent's court</li>
                    <li>A team commits a fault</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The scoring team gains a point and the right to serve. Its players rotate one position clockwise (thus changing who serves).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage.<br>
                    If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 points with a minimum two-point advantage.<br>
                    The best of three or best of five games will win matches.
                </p>
