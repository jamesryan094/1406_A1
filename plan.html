<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong>James Ryan</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
    <!--<ul>-->
        <!--<li>Increase the number of weekly players from 100 to 150</li>-->
        <!--<li>Increase the age range from 35-50 to 15-50</li>-->
    <!--</ul>-->
<p>
    The website must
</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Observe the number of visitors to the website and compare to the number of new recruits to assess the websites contribution to recruitment.</p>
<p>Monitor the number of weekly players before and after the websites launch. Any increase can be attributed to the website.</p>
<p>Observe the age (as it is not asked for on the sign up form) of the new recruits and see if it falls in the target range</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>
    As the community already has members aged 35-50, the website will be targeted at a younger generation, while not deterring the older members. <br>
    This will be achieved by a simple layout (so as to not overwhelm the older audiance) and bright classic "Miami Beach, 1970" colours. <br>
    The main focus of the website is to draw in potential new players with a large sign up campaign, the secondary focus is to deliver news to current members. <br>
    This can be seen clearly on the home page but can also be said of the site in general, <br>with prompts to sign up through out body content and by promoting a fun, friendly lifestyle.
